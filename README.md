## Objective
This Website was created for the purpose of satisfying the criteria for the third Milestone Project (Python and Data Centric Development) as part of Code Institute's Full Stack Software Developer course.
The project features a full-stack website that allows users manage a collective dataset centered around a Human Resource domain. The website was constructed using HTML, CSS, Python, Flask and MongoDB.

## UX & Design

## Strategy Plane

#### Project Goal
The primary goal or 'use case' of the website is to act as a platform where employees and Human Resource professionals of a company can store particular details relating to their employment. Such as, their personal details, contact information. Entitlements such as salary, bonus, position and number of holiday's they have. User's with Administrator level access will be able to assign, edit or remove tasks to employee's based on their email address, they will also be able to set the employees salary, bonus and number of holiday days.
General users can book days off which will be reflected in their total holiday days. they can edit their personal information and mark tasks as complete but they can not edit details about their salary, bonus, position and number of holiday's they have.

#### Ideation
The concept of a HR management platform came from my own experience working in a corporate environment where there was no real way for the HR department to interact with the employee's of the company, other than via email or physically visiting their office. 

#### Site owner goals
